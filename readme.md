# Super Online Market

### To do:

- Style the site well and make sure its responsive and mobile friendly.
- Consider Improving certain features to be more user friendly.
- consider not allowing to cart items of the same product.
- Frontend validations.
- Consider adding to the configuration file.
- document back (api-doc).
- QA each component well, consider using devtools
- Get rid of any console.log.
- Add notes for the one that checks the project such as
  (Decided to not put product_id in the form so it will be handled via the database just like admin assignment,
  Decided to write Async in the name of the BLL functions because they return a promise, I know that they are not async but this is how Dov taught us and I decided to stick with it,
  If I had more time I would have taken more security precautions such as hashing the password in the database or guarding each component in the frontend...).
